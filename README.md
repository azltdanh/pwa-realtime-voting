# PWA Realtime Voting with Ably
​
This is a client side application to be used for a realtime voting built with [Ably](https://www.ably.io/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and powered by [Service Workers](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/). 

Users could do the voting while they are offline, and the result will be submitted when the device is connected again within 24 hours.

The client app could be added to device home screen as an [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

The result page data is stored in sessionStorage. To start a new session, just open the page in a new tab.
